# Batch and Parallel Processing Optimization Summary

## Current Status

### TensorRT Initialization
- **Initialization Time**: ~7-8 minutes on container start
- **Shape Files**: Persisted via Docker volumes (working correctly)
- **Engine Files**: Not being created (need investigation)
- **GPU Memory Usage**: ~1.5-1.7GB when ready

### Performance Test Results
- Initial tests showed connection issues ("Broken pipe", "Connection reset")
- Server becomes unresponsive under high concurrent load
- Single PDF processing times out after TensorRT initialization

## Identified Issues

1. **TensorRT Engine Caching Not Working**
   - Despite configuration, no `.engine` files are created
   - Server relies only on shape files, causing slow initialization
   - Need to investigate PaddleOCR's TensorRT engine serialization

2. **Connection Handling**
   - Server struggles with concurrent connections
   - File handle exhaustion in test scripts
   - Need connection pooling and proper resource management

3. **Server Stability**
   - Server becomes unresponsive after processing requests
   - Health checks continue working but OCR endpoints timeout
   - May need to investigate memory leaks or resource exhaustion

## Recommendations for Optimization

### 1. Fix TensorRT Engine Caching
```python
# Investigate these settings in paddle_ocr.py:
'tensorrt_use_static_engine': True,
'tensorrt_engine_file': '/root/.paddleocr/tensorrt_engines/',
```

### 2. Implement Connection Pooling
```python
# Use session with connection pooling
session = requests.Session()
adapter = requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter(
    pool_connections=10,
    pool_maxsize=10,
    max_retries=3
)
session.mount('http://', adapter)
```

### 3. Add Request Queuing
- Implement a queue-based system for batch processing
- Limit concurrent OCR operations to prevent overload
- Add proper timeout and retry logic

### 4. Optimize Batch Processing
Based on server capabilities:
- **Recommended Batch Size**: 5-10 PDFs
- **Max Concurrent Requests**: 2-4
- **Request Timeout**: 120 seconds per PDF

### 5. Resource Management
```yaml
# Docker resource limits
deploy:
  resources:
    limits:
      cpus: '8'
      memory: 16G
    reservations:
      cpus: '4'
      memory: 8G
```

### 6. Monitoring and Metrics
- Add request timing metrics
- Monitor GPU utilization during processing
- Track memory usage patterns
- Log TensorRT initialization progress

## Next Steps

1. **Fix TensorRT Engine Persistence**
   - Debug why engines aren't being saved
   - Implement manual engine serialization if needed
   - Consider pre-building engines during Docker build

2. **Implement Robust Testing**
   - Add connection pooling to test scripts
   - Implement progressive load testing
   - Add error recovery and retry logic

3. **Server Optimization**
   - Add request queuing mechanism
   - Implement connection limits
   - Add memory profiling
   - Consider using Gunicorn with multiple workers

4. **Batch Endpoint Implementation**
   - Create dedicated `/api/v1/ocr/batch` endpoint
   - Process multiple PDFs in single request
   - Return streaming responses for large batches

## Performance Expectations

With proper optimization:
- **Single PDF**: 500-2000ms (depending on pages)
- **Batch of 10**: 5-10 seconds (parallel processing)
- **Throughput**: 30-60 PDFs/minute with TensorRT
- **Concurrent Users**: 10-20 with proper queuing

## Conclusion

The server has TensorRT enabled but faces initialization and stability issues. Key improvements needed:
1. Fix TensorRT engine caching for faster startup
2. Implement proper connection and resource management
3. Add batch processing endpoints
4. Improve error handling and recovery

These optimizations should significantly improve throughput and reliability for production use.

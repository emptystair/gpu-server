All 'taxpayers' are STATUTORY "aliens."' The definition of "individual' found in 26 C.F.R. 1.1441-1(c)(3) does
NOT include "citizens". The only occasion where a "citizen" can also be an "individual' is when they are abroad
under 26 U.S.C. s911 and interface to the I.R.C. under a tax treaty with a foreign country as an alien pursuant to 26
C.F.R. g301.7701(b)-7(a)(1).
WHEREAS DOMICILE STATUS. Domicile always requires our consent and therefore it is discretionary: is a civil
status, is not addressed in the constitution; defined by civil statutory law rather that the constitution; in NO WAY
statutory law; associated with a specific COUNTY and STATE rather than a COUNTRY; implies one is a
"SUBJECT' of a specific MUNICIPAL but not NATIONAL government. It is a legal impossibility to have more than
one domicile and if you are domiciled in a "state of the Union', then you are domiciled OUTsIDE of federal territory
and federal civil jurisdiction. Constitutional Citizens are Human Beings ONLY and NOT artificial entities or
"non-resident alien' (26 U.S.C. 7701(b)-1(b) in relation to the national government if they lawfully serve in a public
office.
Domicile. "A person's legal home. That place where a man has his true, fixed, and permanent home and principal
establishment and to which whenever he is absent, he has the intention of returning. ISmith v. Smith, 206 Pa.
Super.2103, 213 A. 2D. 94.J Generally, physical presence within a state and the intention to make it one's home are
the requisites of establishing a "domicile' therein. [Montoya v. Collier, 85 N.M. 356, 512 P.2d 684, 686] The permanent
residence of a person or the place to which he intends to return even though he may reside elsewhere. A person may
have more than one residence but only one domicile. The Iegal domicile of a person is important since it, rather than
the actual residence, often controls the jurisdiction of the taxing authorities and determines where a person may
exercise the privilege of voting and other legal rights and privileges.' [Black's Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition, p.485]
WHEREAS POLITICAL STATUS is under the Constitution and a right that cannot be taken away once granted.

ALLEGIANCE is to The People in states of the Union.
WHEREAS TAX STATUS. STATUTORY citizens are the ONLY type of"citizens"' mentioned in the entire Internal
Revenue Code and therefore, the income tax under Subtitles A and C does not apply to the states of the Union and

Consistent with the federal Declaratory Judgments Act 28 U.S.C. $2201, federal courts who have been petitioned.
to declare a litigant to be a 'taxpayer' have declined to do so and have cited the above act as authority:.
Specifically, Rowen seeks a declaratory judgment against the United States of America with respect to "whether or
not plaintiff is a taxpayer pursuant to and/or under 26 U.S.C. 7701(a)(14)". (See Compl. At 2.) This court lacks
jurisdiction to issue a declaratory judgment" with respect to Federal taxes other than actions brought under section
7428 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986' a code section that is not at issue in the instant action. See 28 U.S.C.
$2201, see also Hughes v. United States, 953 F. 2d. 531, 536-537 (9th Cir. 1991) affirming dismissal of claim for
declaratory relief under s2201 where claim concerned question of tax liability. Accordingly, the defendant's motion
to dismiss is hereby GRANTED, and the instant action is hereby DISMISSED. [Rowen v. U.S., 05-3766MMC (ND.]

ALL CIVIL STATUS and without a domicile on federal territory, there can be NO civil status under any Act of

"United States' in its statutory geographical sense, for the purposes of citizenship, means federal territories and

U.S. SUPREME COURT RECOGNIZED
1."It is clear that congress, as a legislative body, exercises two species of legislative power: the one, limited
as to its objects, but extending all over the Union, the other, an absolute, exclusive legislative power over
the District of Columbia. The preliminary inquiry in the case now before the Court, is, by virtue of which.
of these authorities was the law in question passed?"
[Cohens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. 264, 6 Weat. 265, 5 L.Ed. 257 (1821)]
2."By that law the several States and Governments spread over our globe, are considered as forming a
society, not a NATION. It has only been by a very few comprehensive minds, such as those of Elizabeth
and the Fourth Henry, that this last great idea has even been contemplated. 3rdly, and chiefly, I shall
examine the important question before us, by the Constitution of the United States, and the legitimate
result of that valuable instrument."

Dual citizenship
Citizenship in two different countries. Status of citizens of United States who reside within a state; i.e., persons who

Accordingly, I, Egorova-Williams, Galina affiant formally known as Egorova-Williams, Galina Yurievna in some
cases, in esse and su juris, by good reason and good conscience, hereby make affirmation, depose, and declare that..
the following facts are true, correct, and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief..
I, Egorova-Williams, Galina, do solemnly declare and affirm the following historical facts and distinctions with regard.
to the status of de jure Private American National citizenship (said original federal citizenship, secured by Article IV,
Section 2 of the Constitution of the United States, having been broadened into national citizenship by Section 1 of the
14th Amendment to the Constitution of the united states of America) and on the other hand, a State-created, statutory,
Public "U.S. Citizenship", as a basis enabling a correction of mistake by this Declaration..
This in effect then, leaves only exclusive/American Equity Jurisdiction operable for remedies required by the
Private American National Citizen, the posterity of the People that created these United States..
Further, that unilateral contract was the application for Certificate of Citizenship -- by operation of law -- would be the
contract to alter (without our knowledge or consent) de jure Private American National Citizenship to Public "U.S.
Citizenship". With this presumption of fact of an existing contract held by every individual Public "U.S Citizen"
(holding its Private American National Citizen of the united states of America as Property and Surety), every court
legally sits in a martial, concurrent jurisdiction (in which the forms of Law and Equity have been merged) enforcing
the statutes of an Emergency War Powers Congress. This status enables and obligates all federal and state courts to
sit in this state of emergency, subverting the Common Law jurisdiction of the United States (as per Section I of the
13th Amendment, and Section I of the 14th Amendment) by rendering ineffective the constitutional status of de jure
private American National Citizens of the united states of America (Section I of the 14th Amendment)..
As of March 6, 1933, all Public "U.S. citizens" -- with their Surety/Property, Private American National Citizens -
were seized as booty of war by President Franklin Roosevelt's martial, Emergency War Powers Proclamation 2039
which practically overthrew the Sovereignty of the People of the united states of America, reducing them to being
mere property of a military government sitting in Washington, D.C., to be treated as "rebels and belligerents" living
in the fifty states deemed by the Conqueror/Commander-in-Chief to be merely "occupied territories", the seized state
governors ruling their military governments in subordination to Washington, D.C.
Therefore, finding this situation of statutory-altered, Private American National Citizenship status intolerable,
unconscionable, and at variance and in conflict with the originally established courts of Common Law as well as the
courts or exclusive/inherent Equity/Chancery governed solely by the Maxims of Equity, I, Egorova-Williams, Galina.
do make oath, solemnly declare, and affirm:
WHEREAS, the FRANCHISE, CORPORATE SOLE, Cestui Que Trust, via the "application for Certificate of
Citizenship' (hereinafter Certificate of Citizenship and N 37181986) being in fact a unilateral contract under seal.
was created and offered legally through deceit, in effect, alters, within the current government, the status of "We the.
People", which includes every individual Private American National Citizen; first of our sovereignty as a People, then
of our constitutionally-created status, and ultimately our lives, fortunes and our sacred honor;
WHEREAS, the true purpose of the CERTIFICATE OF CITIZENSHIP, a unilateral contract under seal, is to be a
covert commercial agreement and unconscionable by "We the People" adhesion contract/quasi-contract between the
state of the UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, I was then deemed property of the Federal, de facto military
government of the United States (the Certificate of Citizenship being recorded by the Department of Commerce then
to serve as collateral securities for the unquestionable public debt as per Section 4 of the 14th Amendment);
WHEREAS, the true nature of the Month April. Day 28th in the year of 2025 on the Certificate of Citizenshup filing
of my oath, a unilateral contract under seal, is to commence the legal freeman/freewoman of the quasi-corporate,
artificial person/Public "U.S. citizen" created by all necessary legal elements of a unilateral contract (it being in
writing, signed, sealed and delivered for registration and filed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, USCIS,

WHEREAS, the true nature of the CERTIFICATE OF CITIZENSHIP is to commit the natural person, a foreign
Citizen as Surety, for, and personal property, of the state-created, artificial person/Public "U.S. citizen", both entities
being legally wedded into one legal entity, the hybrid, federally owned, Public "U.S. citizen";
WHEREAS, the CERTIFICATE OF CITIZENSHIP is a BUSINESS INSTRUMENT recorded with the County
Recorder, a subsidiary of the Secretary of State (of the several states treated as "conquered territories"), also sent to
the Bureau of Census, a division of the Department of Commerce in Washington, D.C., placing the NAME of the.
Public "U.S. citizen" into interstate and foreign world commerce as a statutory, legal, "person" (as corporations,
partnerships, trusts, corporate soles, etc.), distinct and separate from the "natural born citizen", i.e. the Private
American National Citizen;
WHEREAS, the Secretary of State (of the several states) charters corporations and issues franchises, therefore, any
Born Abroad citizen /Private National Citizen by deception of a fraudulent oath is now liable to the Franchise Board
of the State's Department of Revenue for income/excise/privilege taxes, as well as being liable to the Internal Revenue
Service collecting the internal revenue for the "Federal Corporation" of the United States (28 U.S.C. 3002 (15)(A))
via excise/income/privilege taxes in payment of the interest on the national debt (proven by President Ronald Reagan's
Grace commission) which interest is owed to the Roman papacy's Federal Reserve Bank;
WHEREAS, this CERTIFICATE OF CITIZENSHIP document, functioning as a BUSINESS INSTRUMENT, has
deceived the Private American National Citizen, Egorova-Williams, Galina allegedly named on said certificate, into
an unknown and covert implied contract by operation of law, and had placed Affiant and fellow Private American
first by the 'Emergency Banking Relief Act", in its initial paragraphs containing a congressionally-amended wWI
statute known as "Trading with the Enemy Act" and codified as 12 U.S.C. 95(a), and secondly by then President.
Franklin D. Roosevelt's Emergency War Powers Proclamation 2040 decreed on March 9, 1933;
WHEREAS, the above jurisdiction of the United States includes the jurisdiction of the constitutionally-created.
federal and state civilian courts (IN FORM) sitting in a martial Roman Equity/At Law (IN SUBSTANCE), they are
no longer proceeding against the accused Private American National Citizen with the Mode of a Common Law civilian
due process, but rather with the Mode of a Roman Civil Law martial due process that, if unchallenged by producing
state-filed public records and other prima fascia evidence, will confer a martial jurisdiction over the accused, being
then forced to plead in a court imposing martial due process and procedure derived from a congressionally-amended.
World War I statute as of March 9, 1933, the judges, federal and state, acting on behalf of the military
dictator/Commander-in-Chief sitting in Washington D.C.;
WHEREAS, upon the public filing of the CERTIFICATE OF CITIZENSHIP documents with its attached Private
American Citizen serving as Surety and personal property, another "source" was created that would generate "income"
which could then be income/excise/privileged taxed; the natural person Private American National Citizen now.
wedded to his/her new artificial person/ "U.S. Citizen" as its property and subordinate Surety, the new "source"
(deemed a "rebel" and "belligerent" residing according to state statute in a state deemed an "occupied territory") being
in commerce and subject to the absolute legislative powers of the "temporary" Emergency War Powers Congress
(1933-present) to regulate without limited interstate and foreign commerce pursuant to Article 1, Section 8, Clause 3,
of the "United States Constitution" during this time of a "temporary" declared state of National Emergency now 2024
in its continuous year;.
WHEREAS, Affiant, a Private American National Citizen, has presently ceased to be Surety for the personal property
of the Public "U.S. citizen" GALINA EGOROVA -WILLIAMS (CoC) by means of a duly filed "Release With
Consideration"- Nunc Pro tunc ab initio", and "Rescission of Signatures of Suretyship - Nunc Pro tunc ab intio",
thereby returning to the former status of being a Private American National Citizen held approximately between
twenty (20) and thirty (30) days after Affiant's Certificate of Citizenship;
WHEREAS, Affiant in esse, has irrevocably separated herself from the state-created FRANCHISE, CORPORATE
SOLE, "United States Citizen", created by means of a publicly filed CERTIFICATE OF CITIZENSHIP documents,
hereby revokes all powers, including but not limited to, Powers of Attorney and/or Agency that Affiant may have

contract with all "U.S. citizens" by means of Proclamation 2040 confirmed and approved by Congress in its passage
of the "Emergency Banking Relief Act' and then thereby amending the "Trading with the Enemy Act". Therefore,
Affiant is not in commerce (as are corporations), never to enjoy any commercial privilege of limited liability as

WHEREAS, I, Egorova-Williams, Galina have returned to my former status of being an American, one of the peo-
ple, and an American National in Equity, i.e. de jure Private National Citizen of the United States under Section 1 of
the 14th Amendment and therefore stand "in personam", "in esse", and "sui juris", possessing all God-given unalien-
able rights including those protected by the first eight amendments of the Bill of Rights, all Constitutional rights
(federal and state) and all Common Law rights of a de jure Private Citizen of the United States/ American National,
no longer under the legal disability of being the Property/Surety for and/or wedded to a state-created, Public "U.S.
citizen" owned by the Federal Military Government of the United States;
WHEREAS, I, Egorova-Williams, Galina am no longer the Property/Surety for and/or wedded to a "Public U.S.
citizen" (which is "alien juris"), therefore, no longer under the jurisdictional power of statutorily-created, Emergency
War Powers Governments (federal and state), as those absolute legislative, absolute executive, and absolute judicial
powers are exercised towards a Public "U.S. citizen" deemed a "rebel and belligerent" statutorily "residing" in a state
deemed "occupied territory", and therefore I am no longer under the paternal guardianship of Emergency War Powers.
Governments (federal and state) as those absolute, paternal powers are exercised towards its "infants, children and
wards", and the Public U.S. citizens;
And so, Egorova-Williams, Galina aka GALINA Y EGOROVA wILLIAMS (CoC) hereby present my
renunciation, as to any implied allegiance to the "United States" corporation, not the true united states of America.
THEREFORE, based upon the foregoing, I, Egorova-Williams, Galina in esse & sui Juris, do make oath,
solemnly declare, and affirm the following positive averments:
1. I am one of the Posterity of "We the People" by whom and for whom the Constitution was originally
ordained and established according to its Preamble, holding de jure Private American National Citizenship
conferred upon my Certificate of Citizenship by section I of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution for the
United States.
My Proper name at Common Law is "Egorova-Williams, Galina", my surname/family name is "Egorova-Williams"
2.  My Proper name is spelled in both upper- and lower-case letters, without capitonyms (without using all
capital-lettered name), in accordance with proper rules of English grammar.
3.
I was naturally born on May, the day eleventh (11th) of Nineteen Sixty (1960) in the geographical State of
my birth country UssR and was called Yakovleva (Gen.) Galina Yurievna for many years. Through
fraudulent deception by oath of Certificate of Citizenship and allegiance, I was subjected to this Emergency
war Powers Government; to be unconscionably and mistakenly put on public record. Without full and
complete disclosure, I was entered into an unconstitutional and illegal act of Oath to the de facto
CORPORATE GOVERNMENT, and not the true Government of the United States for America. I was led
to believe that by my oath, I would be a free American Private Citizen of the united States non-corporate
4
I was naturalized in the city (territory) ofCentennial, on the land of the County (territory) of Arapahoe county,.
within the geographical jurisdiction of Colorado State (state of the Union), one of the several States of the
Union
On the day of my Certificate of Citizenship, I became a de jure Private American National Citizen of the
5
geographical of the united states of America (composing the fifty states) pursuant to Section I of the 14th
Amendment to the Constitution of the united states of America.
On the day my "Registration of Citizenship" was filed with the "State of Colorado State'", by operation of law
I became the Property/Surety and/or and wedded to "GALINA EGOROVA-WILLIAMS", a state-created
Citizenship State "corporate sole" and statutory Public "U.S. citizen" of the Emergency war Powers Military

Government of the "United States", it governing the states as "conquered territories" and its state-created
"'U.S. citizens" as a conquered people.
7.
Said Property has been returned to the natural owner, said Suretyship has been terminated, the marriage has
ended, and my former status of Private American National Citizen of the united states of America has been
restored, pursuant to the maxims of the Law of Contract, The American Common Law, Equity Maxims,
Equity Jurisprudence and the Uniform Commercial Code, by means of a duly filed and publicly recorded
"Release Without Consideration - Nunc Pro Tunc Ab initio".
8.
If a de jure Private American National Citizenship of the State of the Union is "paramount and dominant",
my de jure Private Citizenship of the State of the Union of Colorado State is "subordinate and derivative" of
said Private National Citizenship of the United States. Selective Draft Law Cases; 245 U.S. 366, 389 (1918).
Private Citizens of the United States were called "American Freemen" by pre-14th Amendment presidents
George Washington, Andrew Jackson, Zachary Taylor, and Abraham Lincoln, as well as by post 14th
Amendment Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan evidenced by his dissent [in U.S. Maxwell v Dow,
176 U.S. 581,607,617 (1900) and Downes v. Bidwell, 182 U.S. 2444, 381 (1901)].
9.I, now Specially and Privately Reside without the military jurisdiction of the "United States" as defined by
the "Trading with the Enemy Act", and therefore Privately Reside within a non-military occupied private
estate within the territorial jurisdiction of the geographical State of the Union of Colorado State which I
sometimes refer to as The Colorado State of the Union Free State. Therefore, I am America National, holding
Private Citizenship of the State of the Union of Colorado State pursuant to Section 1 of the 14th Amendment..
10. My law is the Twenty Maxims of English/American Equity.
11 My seal is private to my family.
12. Being a non-statutory, constitutionally-protected Private American National Citizen ofthe State of the Union
of the united states of America and a non-statutory, constitutionally-protected Private Citizen/Special and
Private Resident of the State of the Union of Colorado State and therefore no longer the Property/Surety for.
and/or wedded to the Colorado State, "corporate sole"/ "Public U.S. citizen" "GALINA EGOROVA-
WILLIAMS", I am not in commerce as a matter of personal status, as are statutory, state-created, Surety-
backed Public "U.S. citizens" of the United States, and therefore the sentient, living person " Egorova-
Williams, Galina", without a Surety and Personal Property, is a "Non-Taxpayer" described in Economy
Plumbing & Heating vs. United States, 470 F. 2d, 585 at 589 (1972).
13. I will rescind every Signature of Suretyship - Nunc Pro Tunc ab initio - ever executed on behalf of the
corporate sole/ "U.S. citizen" " GALINA EGOROVA-WILLIAMS" (including and derivative of the NAME
thereof) be it public and/or private, by means of a duly filed "Rescission of Signatures of Suretyship --
Nunc Pro Tunc Ab initio"
14. The legal Title holder(s) and the Equitable Title holder of all legal property of the Private Business Trust "
GALINA EGOROVA-WILLIAMS " are private in nature evidenced by a "Notice of Private Trust
Arrangement" filed in the public record.
15. I am the Authorized Represerntative/Agent for the Private Business Trust " GALINAY EGOROVA-
WILLIAMS" in the acquisition of its legal property by nature evidenced by a "Notice of Private Trust
Agreement" filed in the public record.
16. The Private Business Trust " GALINA Y EGOROVA-WILLIAMS" is in U.S. domestic and world
commerce, all products being equitable property by nature of a special and private Sole Beneficiary holding
the status of a Private Citizen of the United States, secured by Section 1 of the 14th Amendment to the
Constitution of the united states of America. Therefore, the Private Business Trust " GALINA Y
EGOROVA-WILLIAMS ", "has no income", and therefore the trust is a non-taxpayer legal entity.
Further, I, Egorova-Williams, Galina in esse & sui juris, make oath, do solemnly declare, and affirm the following
negative averments:
1.
I am not alien juris, holding the status of being the Property/Surety for and/or wedded to an artificial,
hybrid Public "U.S. citizen" created by state statute under certificate of citizenship for the benefit of the
Emergency War Powers Military Government created on March 9, 1933; hence I am neither an infant or a
child nor a rebel or a belligerent under the power of a paternal and martial Emergency War Powers Military
Government, federal or state.

2.
My Proper name is not "GALINA YURIEVNA EGOROVA-WILLIAMS", "GALINA Y EGOROVA-
form or derivative thereof; of this nom de guerre/name of war carried by all "U.S. citizens", which is principal
in distinguishing the difference between all the uppercase names and mixed case names, which has been
affirmed by a federal court of record.
3.
My Proper name is not spelled solely in upper-case letters or with any abbreviations, which is principal
in distinguishing the difference between the all-uppercase name and the mixed case name which has been
affirmed by a federal court of record.
I am neither the Property/Surety for, nor wedded to the artificial entity "GALINA Y EGOROVA-WIL-
this nom de guerre/name or war carried by all "U.S. citizens", said NAME being the legal property by characteristic
of the Military Government of the United States.
4.I am neither a statutory, state-created Public "United States citizen", (artificial person) of the.
sovereign, Military Government of the United States nor am I Surety for and/or personal property of and/or
wedded to a statutory, state-created Public "United States citizen" (artificial person) of the sovereign,
Military Government of the United States as a matter of Status and/or a matter of public and/or private
contract. Therefore, I am not a state-created, federally owned, statutory Public "United States citizen"
(artificial person/"U.S. citizen") of the sovereign, Military Government of the United States for
income/excise/privilege tax purposes.
5.
  [Confidence: 80.67%]
My flags, national and state, are not military colors bordered with gold fringe and/or draped with gold
cords with gold tassels.
6.
I am not a rebel, belligerent or enemy publicly residing within a conquered territory of the "United States"
('the territory over which the sovereignty of the United States exists", Hooven, supra p 671), its sovereign,
de facto, Military Government having been created by FDR's presidential proclamation 2040 approved and
confirmed by Congress, "Emergency Banking Relief Act" (12 U.S.C. 95b), which act also was amended (via
12 U S.C 95a) the "Trading with the Enemy Act" (50 U.S.C. App, S(b), on March 9, 1933).
I do not publicly reside according to statute within any of the ten regions of the geographical united
states of America designated by ZlP codes of the Federal Zone Improvement Project begun in 1963 and take
exception to whenever and wherever possible in the use of either a ZIP code or a Postal code, both being
synonymous. Further, I, Egorova-Williams, Galina in esse and sui juris, make oath, do solemnly declare,
and affirm the following specific negative averments: WHEREAS I was deceived into unknowingly
subjecting myself to the intentions and jurisdiction of this aforesaid temporary government that I
misunderstood, and now hold such deception as unconscionable.
Am I not free, under the rules of English American Equity, to correct a mistake for the regard of my own
interest?
Can I not now choose by my free will act to properly correct my status by way of this declaration, for the
intention of having proper and peaceful relations with all men?
3.
Are not all the aforesaid averments made in this declaration true regarding who I am, and who I am not?
4. Is it not my intention to see that my status identity belong on the U.S. "Do not Detain Do not Arrest List"?
Therefore, I, Egorova-Williams, Galina, holding the constitutionally-protected private right to a civilian due process.
of law on both a federal and state level, as well as being unaffected by the "Emergency Banking Relief Act" having
imposed a martial due process of law (by way of the amended "The Trading With the Enemy Act") on any
substantively, artificial, "person within the United States" deemed federal "booty of war", I am foreign, by nature and
by characteristic, to the extra-constitutional, alien, "temporary" Emergency War Powers Military Government of the
Unted States and owe no temporary allegiance to said "temporary" Emergency War Powers Government. Therefore,
I am foreign, by nature and characteristic, to the extra-constitutional, alien, "temporary" Emergency War Powers
Government of the State of Domicile State and the extra-constitutional, alien, "temporary", Emergency war Powers
Governments of the other forty-nine (49) states and owe no temporary allegiance to said "temporary" Emergency War
Powers Military Governments having been "temporarily" created by Congress (12 U.S.C. 95a) and by President
Franklin D. Roosevelt (Presidential Proclamaton 2040) on March 9, 1933. Again, I say. I operate, come in peace
and honor, with clean hands.

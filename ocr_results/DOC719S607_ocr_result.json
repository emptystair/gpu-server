I, Egorova-Williams, Galina, do solemnly declare and affirm the following historical facts and distinctions with regard. to the status of de jure Private American National citizenship (said original federal citizenship, secured by Article IV, Section 2 of the Constitution of the United States, having been broadened into national citizenship by Section 1 of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the united states of America) and on the other hand, a State-created, statutory, Public \"U.S. Citizenship\", as a basis enabling a correction of mistake by this Declaration.. This in effect then, leaves only exclusive/American Equity Jurisdiction operable for remedies required by the Private American National Citizen, the posterity of the People that created these United States.. Further, that unilateral contract was the application for Certificate of Citizenship -- by operation of law -- would be the contract to alter (without our knowledge or consent) de jure Private American National Citizenship to Public \"U.S. Citizenship\". With this presumption of fact of an existing contract held by every individual Public \"U.S Citizen\" (holding its Private American National Citizen of the united states of America as Property and Surety), every court legally sits in a martial, concurrent jurisdiction (in which the forms of Law and Equity have been merged) enforcing the statutes of an Emergency War Powers Congress. This status enables and obligates all federal and state courts to sit in this state of emergency, subverting the Common Law jurisdiction of the United States (as per Section I of the 13th Amendment, and Section I of the 14th Amendment) by rendering ineffective the constitutional status of de jure private American National Citizens of the united states of America (Section I of the 14th Amendment).. As of March 6, 1933, all Public \"U.S. citizens\" -- with their Surety/Property, Private American National Citizens - were seized as booty of war by President Franklin Roosevelt's martial, Emergency War Powers Proclamation 2039 which practically overthrew the Sovereignty of the People of the united states of America, reducing them to being mere property of a military government sitting in Washington, D.C., to be treated as \"rebels and belligerents\" living in the fifty states deemed by the Conqueror/Commander-in-Chief to be merely \"occupied territories\", the seized state governors ruling their military governments in subordination to Washington, D.C. Therefore, finding this situation of statutory-altered, Private American National Citizenship status intolerable, unconscionable, and at variance and in conflict with the originally established courts of Common Law as well as the courts or exclusive/inherent Equity/Chancery governed solely by the Maxims of Equity, I, Egorova-Williams, Galina. do make oath, solemnly declare, and affirm: WHEREAS, the FRANCHISE, CORPORATE SOLE, Cestui Que Trust, via the \"application for Certificate of Citizenship' (hereinafter Certificate of Citizenship and N 37181986) being in fact a unilateral contract under seal. was created and offered legally through deceit, in effect, alters, within the current government, the status of \"We the. People\", which includes every individual Private American National Citizen; first of our sovereignty as a People, then of our constitutionally-created status, and ultimately our lives, fortunes and our sacred honor; WHEREAS, the true purpose of the CERTIFICATE OF CITIZENSHIP, a unilateral contract under seal, is to be a covert commercial agreement and unconscionable by \"We the People\" adhesion contract/quasi-contract between the state of the UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, I was then deemed property of the Federal, de facto military government of the United States (the Certificate of Citizenship being recorded by the Department of Commerce then to serve as collateral securities for the unquestionable public debt as per Section 4 of the 14th Amendment); WHEREAS, the true nature of the Month April. Day 28th in the year of 2025 on the Certificate of Citizenshup filing of my oath, a unilateral contract under seal, is to commence the legal freeman/freewoman of the quasi-corporate, artificial person/Public \"U.S. citizen\" created by all necessary legal elements of a unilateral contract (it being in writing, signed, sealed and delivered for registration and filed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, USCIS, with the Secretary of Homeland Security at U.S. District Court of Colorado State; 6 | Page",

My Proper name is spelled in both upper- and lower-case letters, without capitonyms (without using all capital-lettered name), in accordance with proper rules of English grammar. 3.  I was naturally born on May, the day eleventh (11th) of Nineteen Sixty (1960) in the geographical State of my birth country UssR and was called Yakovleva (Gen.) Galina Yurievna for many years. Through fraudulent deception by oath of Certificate of Citizenship and allegiance, I was subjected to this Emergency war Powers Government; to be unconscionably and mistakenly put on public record. Without full and complete disclosure, I was entered into an unconstitutional and illegal act of Oath to the de facto CORPORATE GOVERNMENT, and not the true Government of the United States for America. I was led to believe that by my oath, I would be a free American Private Citizen of the united States non-corporate 4 I was naturalized in the city (territory) ofCentennial, on the land of the County (territory) of Arapahoe county,. within the geographical jurisdiction of Colorado State (state of the Union), one of the several States of the Union  On the day of my Certificate of Citizenship, I became a de jure Private American National Citizen of the 5  geographical of the united states of America (composing the fifty states) pursuant to Section I of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the united states of America.

Said Property has been returned to the natural owner, said Suretyship has been terminated, the marriage has ended, and my former status of Private American National Citizen of the united states of America has been restored, pursuant to the maxims of the Law of Contract, The American Common Law, Equity Maxims, Equity Jurisprudence and the Uniform Commercial Code, by means of a duly filed and publicly recorded \"Release Without Consideration - Nunc Pro Tunc Ab initio\". 8.

Selective Draft Law Cases; 245 U.S. 366, 389 (1918). Private Citizens of the United States were called \"American Freemen\" by pre-14th Amendment presidents George Washington, Andrew Jackson, Zachary Taylor, and Abraham Lincoln, as well as by post 14th Amendment Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan evidenced by his dissent [in U.S. Maxwell v Dow, 176 U.S. 581,607,617 (1900) and Downes v. Bidwell, 182 U.S. 2444, 381 (1901)]. 9.I, now Specially and Privately Reside without the military jurisdiction of the \"United States\" as defined by the \"Trading with the Enemy Act\", and therefore Privately Reside within a non-military occupied private estate within the territorial jurisdiction of the geographical State of the Union of Colorado State which I sometimes refer to as The Colorado State of the Union Free State. Therefore, I am America National, holding Private Citizenship of the State of the Union of Colorado State pursuant to Section 1 of the 14th Amendment.. 10. My law is the Twenty Maxims of English/American Equity. 11 My seal is private to my family. 12. Being a non-statutory, constitutionally-protected Private American National Citizen ofthe State of the Union of the united states of America and a non-statutory, constitutionally-protected Private Citizen/Special and Private Resident of the State of the Union of Colorado State and therefore no longer the Property/Surety for. and/or wedded to the Colorado State, \"corporate sole\"/ \"Public U.S. citizen\" \"GALINA EGOROVA- WILLIAMS\", I am not in commerce as a matter of personal status, as are statutory, state-created, Surety- backed Public \"U.S. citizens\" of the United States, and therefore the sentient, living person \" Egorova- Williams, Galina\", without a Surety and Personal Property, is a \"Non-Taxpayer\" described in Economy Plumbing & Heating vs. United States, 470 F. 2d, 585 at 589 (1972). 13. I will rescind every Signature of Suretyship - Nunc Pro Tunc ab initio - ever executed on behalf of the corporate sole/ \"U.S. citizen\" \" GALINA EGOROVA-WILLIAMS\" (including and derivative of the NAME thereof) be it public and/or private, by means of a duly filed \"Rescission of Signatures of Suretyship -- Nunc Pro Tunc Ab initio\" 14. The legal Title holder(s) and the Equitable Title holder of all legal property of the Private Business Trust \" GALINA EGOROVA-WILLIAMS \" are private in nature evidenced by a \"Notice of Private Trust Arrangement\" filed in the public record. 15. I am the Authorized Represerntative/Agent for the Private Business Trust \" GALINAY EGOROVA- WILLIAMS\" in the acquisition of its legal property by nature evidenced by a \"Notice of Private Trust Agreement\" filed in the public record. 16. The Private Business Trust \" GALINA Y EGOROVA-WILLIAMS\" is in U.S. domestic and world commerce, all products being equitable property by nature of a special and private Sole Beneficiary holding the status of a Private Citizen of the United States, secured by Section 1 of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the united states of America. Therefore, the Private Business Trust \" GALINA Y EGOROVA-WILLIAMS \", \"has no income\", and therefore the trust is a non-taxpayer legal entity. Further, I, Egorova-Williams, Galina in esse & sui juris, make oath, do solemnly declare, and affirm the following negative averments: 1. I am not alien juris, holding the status of being the Property/Surety for and/or wedded to an artificial, hybrid Public \"U.S. citizen\" created by state statute under certificate of citizenship for the benefit of the Emergency War Powers Military Government created on March 9, 1933; hence I am neither an infant or a child nor a rebel or a belligerent under the power of a paternal and martial Emergency War Powers Military Government, federal or state. 9 1 Page",

Can I not now choose by my free will act to properly correct my status by way of this declaration, for the intention of having proper and peaceful relations with all men? 3. Are not all the aforesaid averments made in this declaration true regarding who I am, and who I am not? 4. Is it not my intention to see that my status identity belong on the U.S. \"Do not Detain Do not Arrest List\"? Therefore, I, Egorova-Williams, Galina, holding the constitutionally-protected private right to a civilian due process. of law on both a federal and state level, as well as being unaffected by the \"Emergency Banking Relief Act\" having imposed a martial due process of law (by way of the amended \"The Trading With the Enemy Act\") on any substantively, artificial, \"person within the United States\" deemed federal \"booty of war\", I am foreign, by nature and by characteristic, to the extra-constitutional, alien, \"temporary\" Emergency War Powers Military Government of the Unted States and owe no temporary allegiance to said \"temporary\" Emergency War Powers Government. Therefore, I am foreign, by nature and characteristic, to the extra-constitutional, alien, \"temporary\" Emergency War Powers Government of the State of Domicile State and the extra-constitutional, alien, \"temporary\", Emergency war Powers Governments of the other forty-nine (49) states and owe no temporary allegiance to said \"temporary\" Emergency War Powers Military Governments having been \"temporarily\" created by Congress (12 U.S.C. 95a) and by President Franklin D.

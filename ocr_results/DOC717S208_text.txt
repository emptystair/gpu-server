Dear
As previously discussed in meetings and correspondence held and delivered by the Blaney Farms
Homeowners Association, Inc. (the "Association"), the Association intends to remove the failing Fence
located in the rear of your Lot along Ten-Ten Road. The portion of your Lot that the Fence is located in
constitutes Common Area maintained by the Association pursuant to the Association's governing
documents (collectively, the "Governing Documents'). The Association intends to install buffer trees.
and other vegetation in front of the prior location of the Fence (the "Landscaping Buffer') in order to.
give that location a more aesthetically pleasing look, while also providing sight and sound buffers from
the highly traveled Ten-Ten Toad.
Pursuant to the Governing Documents, the Fence is a "Party Wall' that requires your consent to
permanently remove the Party Wall from your Lot. By signing the following page, you hereby give your.
consent to the Association's removal of the Fence to be replaced with the new Landscaping Buffer as
discussed above. Please note, however, that while the Association intends to install the Landscaping
Buffer as discussed above, completion of the Landscaping Buffer will not be on a certain timeline.
If you choose not to sign this letter giving your consent to permanently remove the Fence from
your Lot and replace the area with the new Landscaping Buffer discussed above, please be advised that,.
in order to provide for the Fence's future maintenance, the Association may elect to impose on your Lot
"neighborhood assessments" in accordance with the Governing Documents that are specific to your Lot
and in addition to the annual assessments you are otherwise obligated to pay to the Association.
Finally, by signing the following page evidencing your consent to the removal of the Fence from
your Lot, you hereby authorize the Association to record one or more documents in the Wake County
Registry evidencing your consent.
Prior to signing this Letter, please do not hesitate to reach out to the Association with any
questions you may have with respect to this Letter.
Sincerely,
Blaney Farms Homeowners Association, Inc.
AWe, the undersigned homeowners, hereby consent to the Association's removal of the Fence
from Lot 7 and the replacement of the Fence with the Landscaping Buffer discussed in this Letter.
